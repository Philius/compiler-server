# Protobuf/GRPC with CMake and a forking server example

This is a basic example of a CMake project using Protobuf together with gRPC and fork() in C++.

This is based on  [how to structure gRPC projects with CMake - exmpl-cmake-grpc](https://github.com/faaxm/exmpl-cmake-grpc).

Look there for more details.

This example needs clean-up, there are some issues I worked around.
